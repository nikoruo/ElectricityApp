# ElectricityApp Q1/2022

Description

Goal of the project was to create minimalistic web api to fetch data from open source api. Parse the data, create a csv file of it and pass the data to frontend and show it to the user. Project was part of a job application, and the requested techniques were c# and typescript. In addition, I decided to add React to frontend, as using SPA made the user-experience much more smooth. React is also relatively lightweight, so it was a perfect fit for a simple project such as this.

Learning objectives

Personal goals were to learn c# and dotnet and strenghten my skills in typescript and react.
